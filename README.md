# Winning Space Race With Data Science

## Description
This is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. TYou assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.  

Task is predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.
